# Generate and send invitations to remote patients

In a remote monitoring scenario, your application will need to invite users to participate in your program. This allows your app to seek access to user's data and assign action plans to participants. 

The process to generate and send invitation codes is:

1.  Create an offline web application connection.
2.  Authenticate the connection. This uses the certificate you registered earlier to establish trust.
3.  Generate an invitation code using the [Onboarding REST API](https://developer.healthvault.com/Api).
4.  Send the invitation code to your participant using email or another mechanism.

Once users receive their invitation, they will be invited to download the HealthVault Insights app, sign-up/sign-in to HealthVault and give consent to your application's request to access specific health data. Once consent is received, your application will have access to userâ€™s consented data.

Your application will need to retrieve all user's HealthVault identity and match them up with the user's identity from your ecosystem. See guide on [alternate user identifiers](/healthvault/concepts/advanced/alternate-user-identifiers) to retrieve the list of your patient's and associate an alternate id from your ecosystem.

> [!NOTE]
> In order to use remote monitoring scenarios, users must register their account in the HealthVault Insights app in order to receive remote monitoring scenarios. HealthVault Insights is currently only available to users in the United States and the United Kingdom.
