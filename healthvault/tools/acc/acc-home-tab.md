The HealthVault Application IDs associated with your HealthVault account can be found here. If you don't see your application listed on this page, you may need to either create a new Application ID or "claim" admin rights to your existing Application ID. You can "claim" admin rights from Microsoft HealthVault to an Application ID with your HealthVault account via [submitting a request](https://config.healthvault-ppe.com/ReclaimExistingApplication.aspx). Please provide us the thumb print of your public certificate to confirm the ownership of your application. You can find detailed steps on how to retrieve the Thumbprint of a Certificate at [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms734695.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms734695.aspx)

You can create a new Application ID using the HealthVault Application Manager in the HealthVault SDK or in case you are on a non-Microsoft platform then you can use the [Create a new application](http://www.url.com) process available on Home tab. The SDK is available from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=95e14343-fb98-4549-bd29-225a59423cc9).

<span class="label">Application ID</span>: This is of type GUID and will uniquely identify an application in the PPE environment.

<span class="label">Application Name</span>: The application's name will be displayed here.

All the fields except <span class="label">Valid IP Prefixes</span> are configurable for your Application ID in PPE from Application Configuration Center (ACC) at <https://config.healthvault-ppe.com>. HealthVault provides some added security to applications by supporting calls that come from valid IP addresses of the application which lists under <span class="label">Valid IP Prefixes</span> list. You can inform Microsoft HealthVault about your valid IP address during the [Go-Live process](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/healthvault/bb962148.aspx) or reach [HealthVault Developer Support for SDK](https://support.microsoft.com/oas/default.aspx?prid=13388) to enable <span class="label">Valid IP Prefix</span> list for your HealthVault application.
