Develop apps for the NHS
========================

Microsoft HealthVault has been developed to be an open platform for security enhanced data sharing amongst NHS organisations and the citizen. Our privacy and security enhanced platform takes care of authentication, hosting and data modelling so that NHS Trusts can focus on building apps that citizens need to lead a healthier, happier life.

HealthVault’s information sharing model allows full control of which data elements are shared, who it’s shared with and how long it’s shared for. Custodian access can be granted for a citizen’s record to a person they nominate to help manage their health information.

Any information entered into HealthVault can be, with the citizen’s permission, re-used across many different apps and supplemented by a growing list of devices. Incorporating device technology allows for a richer healthcare experience and ensures patients are able to see an impact on their treatment progress, or raise concerns earlier.
