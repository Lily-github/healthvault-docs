Microsoft HealthVault brand materials
=====================================

The Microsoft HealthVault Brand Materials package contains guidance and assets for appropriately and effectively using HealthVault brand elements to market your HealthVault-enabled solution. Â The package contains:

-   "Connects with HealthVault" Brand Components
-   Badge placement examples
-   Copy guidelines and approved messaging

Only solution providers that have a signed Solution Provider Agreement may use the HealthVault brand elements, as described in the logo license in that agreement. Prior to using any of the brand elements included in this document, a solution provider must undergo a Go Live Review for brand and technical specifications. If your HealthVault- enabled solution has already undergone this review and is currently available to consumers/patients, please use this document to update your branding elements with this latest branding as soon as possible.
