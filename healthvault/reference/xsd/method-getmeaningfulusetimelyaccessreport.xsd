                Gets the Meaningful Use Timely Access Report for an application.
            </summary>

            <remarks>
                The Timely Access Report gives applications information to determine if they meet the Meaningful Use Stage 2 measure for timely patient access to information.
                For ambulatory settings, the measure states "More than 50 percent of all unique patients seen by the EP during the EHR reporting period are provided timely
                (available to the patient within 4 business days after the information is available to the EP)
                online access to their health information subject to the EP's discretion to withhold certain information".
                For the inpatient settings, the measure states "More than 50 percent of all patients who are discharged from the
                Inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) of an eligible hospital or CAH have their information available online
                within 36 hours of discharge". (For more information regarding this measure see "View, download, and transmit to a 3rd party" in
                the Meaningful Use Stage 2 Reference Grid found here: https://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/meaningful-use-stage-2.)

                For regular documents, HealthVault returns an entry in the report for each CCDA document received by the data source having an event date
                (which is the visit date for ambulatory settings, and the discharge date for inpatient settings) within the specified
                reporting period filter. Each entry consists of the date the document was made available to the patient in HealthVault, the event date,
                and the patient ID as specified in the CCDA document. The application can use this information to help calculate the percentage value of the measure.

                For DOPU, HealthVault returns an entry in the report for each CCDA document received by the data source using DOPU.
                The entries are filtered to those that were made available to HealthVault within the specified available date range filter.
                Each entry consists of the date the document was made available to the patient in HealthVault, and the identifier of the DOPU package that was made available to the patient.
                The application can use this information to help calculate the percentage value of the measure.

                Note that HealthVault does not know the full list of patients seen by the provider and does not apply any logic to determine whether patients
                had access to the data within the timeframe specified by the measure. To calculate the percentage for this measure, the application must take into
                account the total number of unique patients seen or discharged within the desired reporting period, and for each patient determine if the data was made
                available to them within the measure's specified timeframe.
