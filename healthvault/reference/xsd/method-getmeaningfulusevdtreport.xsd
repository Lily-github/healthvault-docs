        Gets the Meaningful Use VDT Report for an application.

      <remarks>
          The View, Download, and Transmit (VDT) Report gives applications information to determine if they meet the Meaningful Use Stage 2 measure
          for patients taking action on their health information. For ambulatory settings, the measure states
          "More than 5 percent of all unique patients seen by the EP during the EHR reporting period (or their authorized representatives)
          view, download or transmit to a third party their health information". For inpatient settings, the measure states
          "More than 5 percent of all patients who are discharged from the Inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) of an eligible hospital
          or CAH (or their authorized representative) view, download or transmit to a third party their information during the EHR reporting period."
          (For more regarding this measure see "View, download, and transmit to a 3rd party" in the Meaningful Use Stage 2 Reference Grid found here: https://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/meaningful-use-stage-2.)

          HealthVault returns an entry in the report for each patient to which the data source has sent a CCDA document and
          where the patient has viewed, downloaded, or transmitted to a 3rd party health information from the health record.
          The entries in the report are filtered such that only those CCDAs having an event date (which is the visit date for ambulatory settings,
          and the discharge date for inpatient settings) within the specified reporting period filter, will lead to the receiving patient being included in the report.
          The application can use the patient identifiers in the report to help calculate the percentage value of the measure.

          Note that HealthVault does not know the full list of patients seen by the provider. To calculate the percentage for this measure,
          the application must take into account the total number of unique patients seen or discharged within the desired reporting period.
