#HealthVault REST API

HealthVault offers a REST API for a select set of scenarios. If your scenario is not covered in the documentation below, you may need to use the [HealthVault XML API](/healthvault/concepts/xml-api/) and an appropriate SDK. 

## Scenarios
* **Onboarding** - Invite patients to join onboard into your Action Plans
* **Action Plans** - Administrate Action Plans for onboarded patients and monitor adherence
* **Goals** - Set health goals for onboarded patients

## API Versions
HealthVault requires that clients specify the version of the REST API that they are retrieving using the *x-ms-version* header. For example&#58;

> Request Headers:
> x-ms-version&#58; 1.0-preview

> [!NOTE] 
> API versions marked -preview or -rc indicate preview versions of the API. Breaking changes may occur on preview versions of the API.
